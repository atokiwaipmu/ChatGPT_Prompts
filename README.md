## Code Refactoring (Python)

```md
Refactor the following Python code into multiple well-structured methods to enhance readability, maintainability, and reusability. The refactored code should adhere to Python community standards, including:  

- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Follow proper naming conventions, indentation, and line spacing.  
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each function should serve a distinct purpose.  
- **Meaningful Function Names**: Use descriptive and self-explanatory names.  
- **Docstrings & Comments**: Provide clear explanations where necessary.  
- **Avoid Code Duplication**: Extract repeated logic into reusable methods.  
- **Error Handling (if applicable)**: Implement proper exception handling where needed.
